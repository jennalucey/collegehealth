                <p>According to the Journal of American College Health, college is a critical season for young adults regarding the direction of their health choices and their relationship with food. Despite the upward statistics of obesity in Americans today, for college students, especially, the numbers are not in their favor. A study concerning the spread of the obesity epidemic specifies that college students are more at risk than non-university attendees to gain weight. Despite the more complex causes and factors accredited to obesity, one impactful component is the lack of dietary education and health science in higher education. One lit study suggests “a need for comprehensive nutrition programming designed specifically for the college student” to target their unique needs”. Digital resources, educational courses, or simple print materials posted in dining halls providing supplemental dietary information for students considerably aids college students in making positive dietary decisions, as well as the forming of healthy and balanced habits.

    <p>As follows is an interview with N.C. State sophopmore and education major, Claire Garner. Based upon a study of the uses and design of One Earth in the Talley Student Union, Garner shares with Jenna Lucey and Callie Moreland her experience trying to eat healthy on campus and her opinions on health initiatives of the university to better aid students in health management.</p>
            </blockquote>
    

<p>Interviewer: Hey Claire! Do you eat at One Earth on campus very often?</p>
                
<p>Claire: I eat at One Earth a lot, just because they have so many different healthy options as opposed to other dining options on campus. </p>

<p>Interviewer: Would you say you try to eat pretty healthy? </p>

<p>Claire: I do, I try to eat healthy.</p>
        
<p>Interviewer: Do you think that is decently easy or is it difficult with trying to find options on campus?</p>
      
<p>Claire: I think it can definitely be difficult on campus because there’s not a whole lot of options so like maybe the food that is healthy is food that you don’t enjoy eating but with discipline and just eating healthier food, you’ll start to like them more, but it just takes being hard on yourself a little bit.</p>

<p>Interviewer: Do you think that One Earth is the best option as far as on campus dining goes or is there another place that you’ll go? </p>

<p>Claire: I think that One Earth and Case are pretty equally tied for me, as far as healthy food and good options, because obviously Case has more of a variety, but One Earth pretty much guarantees a lot of healthy foods. When comparing to Talley or the Atrium, One Earth is probably the best.</p>

<p>Interviewer: Do you think that NC State, as a whole, does a decent job at providing students with tools to eat healthy?</p>

<p>Claire: I think they do do a decent job; I think they can do better, for instance like I have some friends that are vegan and there’s not many options out there for  variations so there’s really only One Earth and many of the other restaurants so if that’s what they want then they are kinda stuck but I think they do a decent job but they could do better providing more options to vegans.</p>
            
<p>Interviewer: So would you want to see more healthy options advertised or more involvement from nutritionists on campus?</p>

<p>Claire: Yeah, I think it would help people who are looking for healthier options and also people who might choose ones if they were advertised more and like theirs always foods you on the TV screens, I think that would help a lot, what was the other part of the question?</p>

<p>Interviewer: On campus nutritionists.</p>

<p>Claire: Yeah, I think maybe if people also understood the effects of nutrition, like having that as more of a presence on campus, people would learn about it more easily. I think that also could help it be more common because I think that people just don’t understand how important it actually is for your wellbeing.</p>

<p>Interviewer: Do you have any ideas as to things that you wished state offered to educate like you’re talking about eating and just the importance of it? </p>

<p>Claire: I think it should maybe be brought up at orientation more. I know at orientation they talk about your different food options and stuff like that, but they don’t really talk much about why it’s important. Also, there’s definitely a lot of programs on campus that help with anxiety and depression and all the other stuff that people are going through in college, but I think so much of a part of just feeling good, which is what a lot of that stems to, is fueling your body with good things, so when that’s not incorporated into teaching and resources that are given to people it’s not really going help as much as other things.</p>

<p>Interviewer: Okay so just finishing up, as far as One Earth goes specifically how would you describe your experience of getting food there? Do you think that it’s pretty simple? Do you have trouble deciding? </p>

<p>Claire: I definitely have trouble deciding sometimes but I really like that they change up the menu once a week, like the global area, so that you get to try something new. While there are a lot of options there, some of them are a little weird and you might not want them, but because they change it up so often you’re not going to get bored with it, so I really like how customizable things are. You can really make things exactly how you want them and still eat healthy.
